# Stock_price_Scraping
To do this project, I downloaded the beautiful soup 4 library and I started to scrape from Yahoo finance. Once I was able to scrape the data, I then placed it in to a (sqlite3) database. 
Lastly, My goal is to place that data into my flask web framework and also get cool graphs, once I have enough data. To run this project, you will need the following libraries.

run this command: pip install Flask (windows) or sudo pip3 install Flask (mac & Linux)
&run this command: pip3 install beautifulsoup4 (windows) or  sudo pip3 install beautifulsoup4 (mac or linux)
